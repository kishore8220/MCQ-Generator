# MCQ-Generator
This project is a smart, file-based MCQ (Multiple Choice Questions) generator built using LangChain, Ollama (Qwen3), and document parsing tools. It takes educational content from PDF, DOCX, or TXT files and generates well-structured multiple-choice questions automatically, saving the results in both .txt and .pdf formats.
